RDF in-direct paths
============================

The code has been written to solve some specific issue faced by the author while finding in-direct relations (path) between two concepts under various namespaces adopted by a domain ontology.

Note: Code has been written using Netbean (Java) 

###  Purpose
Code has been written per particular usage for author's project but may help someone else confronting similar issue.


## Supported Platforms

- **Java**<br>

currently it only supports RDF/XML only.


### Input
RDF file (sample files are in data folder)

The parser finds in-direct relations among RDF concepts e.g. relation between a 'Book' and publication date. There is no direct property that can relate these two and we have a multi-link path to find this relation i.e. 'Book' got a publication event, A publication even got property event time, Event time got a Calendar year that has a label. In short we will come up with following statements (for SPARQL)

{?book a bibo:Book}

{?event a blt:PublicationEvent}

{?book blt:publication ?event}

{?event event:time ?time}

{?time rdfs:label ?year}

The code returns simple string statements that can be converted to SPARQL statements or saved in database (whatever needed)

### Output

Node Paths Called
Paths: [

        {http://purl.org/ontology/bibo/Book [dct:creator] http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Agent},

Paths: [

        {http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person  [bio:event]  http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/Death}
        
       ]

#Note

The comma separated paths (int he out-put) are individual object type propert paths e.g. Book has a dct:creator that is a Person. The paths without comma are indirect graph paths e.g.Book has dct:creator that is a Person.. and Person got bio:Event that is Birth.
